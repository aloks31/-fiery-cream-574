        description:"A recent study showed a connection between depression, food, and the emergence of frailty. This study was published in The Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences. Affecting 10-15 per cent of older persons, frailty is characterised as an identifiable state of heightened vulnerability brought on by a loss in function across several physiological systems. It frequently co-occurs with other medical problems, such as depression. Affecting 10-15 per cent of older persons, frailty is characterised as an identifiable state of heightened vulnerability brought on by a loss in function across several physiological systems. It frequently co-occurs with other medical problems, such as depression. The development of frailty is thought to be significantly influenced by diet. This is one of the first studies to attempt to understand the relationship between dietary inflammation and frailty and depression. According to the exploratory data, middle-aged and older persons who consume a pro-inflammatory diet are more likely to simultaneously acquire frailty and depression symptoms than they are to do so separately.",
