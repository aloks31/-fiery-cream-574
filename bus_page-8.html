            <h4>Reported By:DNA Web Team| Edited By: DNA Web Team |Source: DNA webdesk |Updated: Jul 19, 2022, 12:12 PM IST</h4>
            <img src="https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2022/07/20/2523879-untitled-design-2022-07-20t215908.620.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Recently, the Ministry of Commerce introduced a rule to make work from home (WFH) legal for employees of IT/ITeS Special Economic Zones (SEZ). Rule 43A states that those who are temporarily incapacitated, those travelling and employees who are working offsite are eligible for WFH.
                <br>
                As per the official notification, WFH may be extended to a maximum of 50 per cent of total employees, including contractual employees of the unit and that work from home would be allowed for a period of one year. However, that period can be extended for another year by the Development Commissioner (DC) of SEZs.
                <br>
                Employees of SEZ units who are already working from home will be provided a transition period of 90 days to seek approval. SEZ units will provide both equipment and secured connectivity for employees to perform operations smoothly while working from home. 
                <br>
                With the introduction of the WFH model during the pandemic surge, more and more employees are now preferring a WFH model for reasons including more personal time with family and friends and of course the freedom to perform jobs at their own pace. 
                <br>
                A study from Indeed shows the number of global remote workers has almost tripled since the Covid-19 surge. From just 2.5 per cent in January 2020 to almost 7.5 per cent in September 2021, with countries like Ireland, Spain and the UK seeing the greatest increases.
                <br>
                A study, by Tech Talent Outlook by job site SCIKEY, revealed that 64 per cent of employees feel their productivity grows while working from home and feel less stressed.
                <br>
                Some companies like Mondelez and Tata Steel are already hirings for permanent work-from-home roles, while companies like Maruti Suzuki and ITC are adopting the partial remote working approach where employees come to the office only for a couple of days.
                <br>
                Reports also state that the online job portal, Monster India has posted over 4,000 work-from-home jobs in 2022. Naukri.com also reported a growing trend of permanent remote jobs.
